# Airplane

I will start an sfml project which will have two planes who move by clicking with your mouse, when they collide there will be
a small explosion.

PLANES:
for the planes I will set their origin and position somewhere on the screen i will also set rotaion value for it when they are
making a turn backwards or to the sides.
